## TO TEST MODEL: 
Run model_tester.py. 
Note: Make sure to change the file name for which image to be tested. Feel free to test own images (upload under test\ folder).

## TO RUN THE GAME ON LAPTOP: 
Run quick_draw_game.py. 
Note: This file probably won't be updated with new settings as it will be done on the iPad version.

## TO RUN THE GAME ON IPAD (or other device):
1. Run app.py in the quickdraw_game folder on your **laptop**.
2. Make sure you are on the same Wi-Fi network on your laptop and your iPad.
3. While running, go to http://[your laptop IP address]:7272 on your **iPad** or other device.
4. Only terminate the program when done.
Note: do not share the port "7272" with anyone. Obviously don't share your IP either.
